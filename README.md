# AI555 Software and code

Python-based software for determining the component values (R1, R2, and C) of an astable 555 timer circuit to achieve the desired high and low duration for square wave generation

## Description

This software presents an AI-based methodology for optimizing component values (R1, R2, and C) in astable 555 timer circuits, used for generating clock pulses and square waves. 

The approach combines grid-based and gradient-based search techniques to offer multiple practical solutions, including precise, market-available, and minimal circuit area configurations. 

The study aims to streamline the design process for engineers, with the software and source code available on GitHub. This research addresses the gap in finding feasible solutions for desired timing periods in 555 timer circuits.
